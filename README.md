# Distributed_Vision

### Project Objective
Integrate state of the art facial detection and inverted indexing in the Spark-Tensorflow environment to allow for near real time reverse image search on a roster of faces. Benchmark the accuracy and runtime trades off of state-of-the-art facial detection algorithms and data storage systems for facial detection and inverted indexing. Explore improvements to these algorithms and data storage systems.
